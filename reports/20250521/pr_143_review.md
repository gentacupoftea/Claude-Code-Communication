## CI Failures
Found several CI failures needing immediate resolution:

1. Import errors in tests:
```python
# tests/test_imports.py still contains:
import shopify_mcp_server  # Should be: import conea
```

2. Configuration files with old references:
```
Found 7 references to "shopify_mcp_server" in Docker files

```

3. Missing migration guidance in documentation

## Technical Issues Found

### Import Statement Issues
