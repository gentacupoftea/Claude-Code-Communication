## Technical Review

### Error Handling Improvements
- ✅ Fixed JSON parsing for malformed responses
- ✅ Added proper handling for Rakuten-specific error codes

### Response Processing
- Better handling of unexpected field formats
- Proper handling of null values in responses
- Pagination mechanism enhancement
- Metadata extraction improved
- Added support for multiple response formats

### Edge Cases
- Handles partial API outages

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Follows project coding standards
- Good separation of concerns

## Rename Impact
