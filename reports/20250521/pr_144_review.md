## Security Tests
```
Running tests for Amazon credential rotation...
✓ Test credential encryption
✓ Test key rotation timing
✓ Test automatic refresh
✓ Test fallback mechanism
✓ Test notification system
✓ Test audit logging

All 27 tests passed!

## Technical Review

### Security Implementation
- ✅ Credentials stored using envelope encryption
- ✅ KMS-compatible key management
- ✅ Proper secret rotation with zero downtime
- ✅ Configurable rotation schedules
- ✅ Audit logging for all credential operations

### Rotation Logic
- Implements time-based trigger for rotation
- Includes usage-based triggers (after X API calls)
- Gradual phase-in of new credentials
- Maintains old credentials during transition period
- Handles rotation failures gracefully

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive retry logic
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Failure notification system
- Automatic rollback on failed rotation
- Detailed error logging for debugging

### Integration
- Well integrated with existing Amazon API client
- Uses improved caching system from PR #146
- Configuration parameters properly documented
- Compatible with multiple deployment environments

## Rename Impact
- Low impact score (4/10)
- Contains few references to package structure
- Will need minor adjustments after rename

## Dependencies
- Depends on PR #146 (caching mechanism)
- PR #149 depends on this PR

## Conflicts
- Medium-level conflict with PR #149 in:
  - `src/api/amazon.py`
  - `tests/api/test_amazon.py`
- Low-level conflict with PR #145 in:
  - `src/utils/security.py`

## Recommendation
**APPROVE**: This PR enhances security without significant downsides and is well-implemented.

## After-Merge Actions
1. Update security documentation with new credential handling procedures
2. Schedule a security review to validate the implementation
3. Set up monitoring for rotation events
4. Coordinate with PR #149 author to resolve conflicts
