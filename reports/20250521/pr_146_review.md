# PR #146 Review: Implement improved caching mechanism

## Overview
This PR implements an improved caching system with support for both Redis and Memcached backends, and introduces a more efficient cache invalidation strategy.

## Files Changed
- `src/utils/cache.py`
- `src/utils/redis_client.py` (new)
- `src/utils/memcached_client.py` (new)
- `src/config.py`
- `tests/utils/test_cache.py`
- `tests/utils/test_redis_client.py` (new)
- `tests/utils/test_memcached_client.py` (new)
- `examples/caching_example.py`
- `docs/README_CACHE.md`

## Performance Tests
```
Test results summary:
- Cache hit ratio increased from 76% to 92%
- Average lookup time reduced by 65%
- Memory usage reduced by approximately 30%
```

## Technical Review

### Architecture Improvements
- ✅ Abstracted cache backends through common interface
- ✅ Implemented configurable TTL per cache type
- ✅ Added support for both Redis and Memcached
- ✅ Improved key generation strategy to reduce collisions

### Implementation Details
- New `CacheBackend` abstract class with consistent interface
- Smart cache key namespacing to prevent conflicts
- Efficient serialization/deserialization for complex objects
- Batch operations for improved performance
- Circuit breaker pattern to handle cache backend failures

### Memory Optimization
- Implemented LRU eviction strategy
- Added memory usage monitoring
- Configurable maximum cache size
- Compression for large cached values

### Code Quality
- Well-documented with clear examples
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Consistent error handling
- Follows project coding standards

## Rename Impact
