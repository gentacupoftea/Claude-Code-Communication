## Code Improvement Suggestions

### 1. Add Abstract Base Classes
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AcquisitionProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def fetch(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        pass
```

### 2. Implement Custom Exceptions
```python
class CSVProcessorError(Exception):
    """Base exception for CSV processor"""
    pass

class EncodingError(CSVProcessorError):
    """Raised when encoding detection/conversion fails"""
    pass

class ValidationError(CSVProcessorError):
    """Raised when data validation fails"""
    pass
```

### 3. Add Retry Mechanism
```python
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt

@retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10),
       stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
async def fetch_with_retry(self):
    return await self.fetch()
```

### 4. Improve Japanese Support
```python
import mojimoji  # for half/full-width conversion

def normalize_japanese_text(text: str) -> str:
    # Convert half-width to full-width
    text = mojimoji.han_to_zen(text)
    # Additional normalization
    return unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', text)
```

### 5. Add Configuration Validation
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class CSVProcessorConfig(BaseModel):
    encoding: str = "utf-8"
    batch_size: int = 1000
    memory_limit_mb: int = 1024
    
    @validator('batch_size')
    def validate_batch_size(cls, v):
        if v < 100:
            raise ValueError('Batch size must be at least 100')
        return v
```

## Notable Good Implementation Points

1. **Modular Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns with clear boundaries
2. **Async Support**: Proper use of async/await for I/O operations
3. **Configuration Flexibility**: Comprehensive configuration options
4. **Data Quality Focus**: Built-in validation and quality reporting
5. **Memory Management**: Chunk-based processing with garbage collection
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new acquisition sources or transformations
7. **Error Tracking**: Detailed error collection throughout pipeline

## Conclusion

The CSV processor implementation shows solid engineering practices with a well-thought-out architecture. The main areas requiring immediate attention are testing coverage, error handling improvements, and enhanced Japanese data support. With the suggested improvements, this could become a robust, production-ready component.
