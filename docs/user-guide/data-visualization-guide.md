# Data Visualization Guide

This guide explains how to use the new analytics dashboard for visualizing Shopify data.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Analytics** from the main menu after logging in. The dashboard displays charts and key metrics derived from your store's orders.

## Charts

- **Sales Trend** shows daily sales volume.
- **Sales by Category** illustrates the proportion of revenue by product category.

These graphs update automatically based on your store data.

## Metrics

Below the charts, aggregate figures are shown:

- **Total Revenue** – sum of all order totals
- **Total Orders** – count of processed orders
- **Average Order Value** – revenue divided by order count

Use these insights to track performance and identify trends.
