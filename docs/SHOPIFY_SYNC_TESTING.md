# Shopify Sync Engine Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Shopify synchronization engine implemented in the MCP server.

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy involves multiple levels of testing to ensure the sync engine functions correctly and reliably:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between components
3. **Error Handling Testing**: Verifying proper handling of error conditions
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Testing boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following components:

### Core Classes

- `ShopifySyncEngine`: The main synchronization engine
- `SyncResult`, `SyncRecord`, `SyncHistory`: Data models for tracking sync operations
- Celery tasks for scheduled synchronization

### Key Functionality

- Platform registration and initialization
- Data synchronization (products, inventory, orders, customers)
- Scheduler operation
- Error handling and reporting
- Status tracking and history management
- Multi-platform synchronization

## Test Structure

Test files are organized as follows:

- `tests/sync/test_shopify_sync.py`: Unit tests for `ShopifySyncEngine`
- `tests/sync/test_shopify_sync_tasks.py`: Unit tests for Celery tasks
- `tests/sync/test_sync_models.py`: Unit tests for sync data models
- `tests/sync/test_integration.py`: Integration tests for multi-platform sync
- `tests/sync/conftest.py`: Common fixtures and mocks

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all sync engine tests
pytest tests/sync -v

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/sync/test_shopify_sync.py -v
pytest tests/sync/test_shopify_sync_tasks.py -v
pytest tests/sync/test_sync_models.py -v
```

### Testing with Coverage

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
pytest tests/sync --cov=src.sync --cov-report=term -v
```

### Testing Specific Functionality

```bash
# Test specific functionality using markers
pytest tests/sync -m "not integration" -v  # Skip integration tests
pytest tests/sync -m "integration" -v     # Run only integration tests
```

## Test Development Guidelines

When developing new tests or extending existing ones:

1. **Use fixtures**: Leverage the provided fixtures in `conftest.py` to maintain consistency
2. **Mock external dependencies**: Avoid making real API calls in tests
3. **Test both success and failure paths**: Ensure error handling is properly tested
4. **Verify side effects**: Check that external calls are made correctly
5. **Maintain isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
6. **Thread safety**: Be careful when testing threaded code to avoid race conditions

## Test Data

Test data includes:

- Mock Shopify API responses (products, inventory, orders, customers)
- Mock external platform APIs
- Sample sync results and history

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Async Testing

When testing asynchronous functions, ensure proper async/await usage and mocking:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    # Use AsyncMock for async methods
    mock_api.async_method = AsyncMock(return_value=True)
    result = await function_under_test()
    assert result is True
```

### Thread Testing

When testing threaded code, make sure to:

- Mock long-running operations
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Monitor and handle thread state

### Celery Task Testing

For Celery tasks:

- Mock the task execution environment
- Test both the task function and task registration
- Verify task parameters are correctly processed

## Maintainability

To maintain the test suite over time:

1. Update tests when changing the sync engine functionality
2. Keep mock data current with API changes
3. Periodically review and update test coverage
4. Address test failures promptly
5. Document complex test scenarios

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements to the test suite:

1. Add performance benchmarking tests
2. Add load testing for high-volume sync operations
3. Add more comprehensive error scenario testing
4. Improve test isolation for integration tests
