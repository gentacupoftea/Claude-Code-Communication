# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `shopify-mcp-server`
   - Description: "MCP server for Shopify API integration with Claude Desktop"
   - Make it public
   - DO NOT initialize with README, gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/mourigenta/shopify-mcp-server
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopify-mcp-server.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

That's it! Your Shopify MCP Server is now on GitHub.
